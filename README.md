# digitalAssetManagement
I want to keep track of the digital assets I create so that any products can be derived and linked to the original items 
Some are written in python and require some atypical python packages to support the files I'm keeping track of.
Some are written in R, such as PDF conversions, as those had easily accessible packages for doing that sort of work.
