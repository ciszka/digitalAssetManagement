# Name:        Digital Asset Management program
# Purpose: Fill a table based on what is in a folder I want this to fill a table
#          so I can know what the underlying images are that make up an
#          institutions model also want to write something that will append new
#          information but and not delete or added new ones so that as I add new
#          material (either to the same file or read from different files I can
#          apply this. This portion is currently set up to write to a .csv* but
#          this will eventually be imported into Access (most likely just for
#          convience of interface use) therefore it would be good to write some
#          sequel for this as well which will go into another file
